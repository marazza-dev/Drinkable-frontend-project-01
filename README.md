# Drinkable

## Frontend Training Project

This is a training project inspired by CodingGarden CJ seedling-school-01-frontend-project. To make things "harder" this will be my first GitHub repo to go online!
The idea behind the project is pretty simple: users can search for cocktails and they'll get back the ingredients or go for a blank search to get a random drink.

Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated!
